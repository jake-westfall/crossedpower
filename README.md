This page hosts the R code underlying the power analysis app distributed with the following paper:

[Westfall, J., Kenny, D. A., & Judd, C. M. (2014). Statistical power and optimal design in experiments in which samples of participants respond to samples of stimuli. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 143(5), 2020.](http://jakewestfall.org/publications/crossed_power_JEPG.pdf)

A live version of the app can be found [here](http://jakewestfall.org/power/).

This code relies on the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) library. To run the app locally, you will need to download the R script files, install the Shiny library, and point Shiny to the R scripts. A nice tutorial can be found [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/).
